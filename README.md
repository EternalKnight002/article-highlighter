A simple, privacy-focused Chrome extension for highlighting text on web pages, adding notes, and exporting your research. Built with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS‚Äîno frameworks or build tools required.

## About The Project

In an age of information overload, being able to actively read and retain key information is crucial. Article Highlighter was built to be a lightweight, intuitive tool for students, researchers, and anyone who reads online. It allows you to mark important sections of articles, attach notes for context, and revisit them anytime. All your data is stored locally in your browser, ensuring your research remains private.

The extension provides two powerful export options:
1.  **Export Page:** Saves the full article as a PDF with your highlights inline for context.
2.  **Export Highlights:** Creates a clean, concise PDF summary containing only the text you highlighted and your notes‚Äîperfect for quick revisions.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Select & Highlight:** Easily highlight text on any webpage with a single click.
* **Add Notes:** Attach notes to any highlight for deeper context.
* **Persistent Storage:** Your highlights are automatically saved per-page and reappear when you revisit.
* **Popup Management:** A clean popup interface to view, manage, and navigate to your highlights.
* **Dual Export to PDF:**
    * Export the full webpage with highlights.
    * Export a summary document with only your highlights and notes.
* **Privacy First:** All data is stored locally in your browser's `localStorage` and is never sent to any server.
* **Framework-Free:** Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for maximum performance and simplicity.
